Web scanner for finding vulnerabilities and information leaks from Israeli sites, inspired by Cyber-Cyber podcast.

Key notes:
1. If you want to add your own searches you will need to update "search_db.py" and maybe also the "search Parameters" section.

Requirements:
1. MacOS / Windows
2. python3
3. selenium (pip/pip3 install selenium)
4. chromedriver (I've used version 99.0.4844.51, https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)
5. fake-useragent (pip install fake-useragent)
